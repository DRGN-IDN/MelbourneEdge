Hi Edge-perience team. This document will allow you to be able to install all the required software
& dependencies to run the Edge-perience project on git.

After installing all of the important software such as Node.Js & MongoDB, we can actually start 
installing dependencies for the git repository.

Please ensure that you have followed the installation guide in the root folder's REAMDE.md file
As it is a pre-requisite step to this frontend guide.

+==============+
|       Step guide        |
+==============+

Step 1: Open the project in your terminal/command prompt (edge-perience_2020t3)

Step 2: access the frontend folder by entering the command: 'cd frontend'

Step 3: To install dependencies, navigate to the frontend folder and type: npm i @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react
@testing-library/user-event react react-dom react-scripts web-vitals

This will install a 'node_modules' folder. This folder differentiates dependant on OS. This means
That it needs to be installed by the user. After this is installed, DO NOT make changes inside the 
folder. Our repository has this folder included in the git ignore file and will not be pushed with 
The other files in the repo.

|          Results!         |
